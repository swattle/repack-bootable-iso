Perl script for editing and repacking any ISO file into a bootable image. Script authored by Intel Corporation. Modified and redistributed by Swattle to accustom repacking of the latest images. 

## On Linux

### Installing mkisofs

`apt-get install mkisofs`

### Editing ISO image

`mkdir /tmp/custom_iso`

`cd /tmp/custom_iso/`

`mount -t iso9660 -o loop ~/original.iso /mnt/`

`cd /mnt`

mnt is read-only, thus we need to copy the files in it in order to modify the files.

`tar cf - . | (cd /tmp/custom_iso; tar xfp -)`

You can now modify the files for making a preseed for example!

### Back in .iso

If not, go back to your /tmp/custom_iso folder

`cd /tmp/custom_iso`

Copy this line, modify it and paste it in order to create the .iso

`mkisofs -o output.iso -b isolinux.bin -c boot.cat -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -J -R -V "Custom ISO Preseed" .`

### Make it bootable with isohybrid

Install isohybrid:

`sudo apt install syslinux-utils`

Then simply type the following to make it bootable:

`sudo isohybrid output.iso`

## On macOS

### Install brew 

Follow https://brew.sh/

### Install requirements

In order to install mkisofs, you need to get the cdrtools package for macOS:

`brew install cdrtools`

### Prepare folders

Make two folders: iso and custom.

`ro_iso` is going to be where the files of the iso will be mounted, read only.

`custom` will be where you will be able to modify the files

`mkdir ro_iso && mkdir custom`

### Attaching, mounting and editing

`hdiutil attach -nomount ubuntu.iso`

List the disks and get the disk image name usually `/dev/disk2`:

`diskutil list`

We will use `/dev/disk2`.

Now you can mount the disk into the read-only folder:

`mount -t cd9660 /dev/disk2 ro_iso`

We now need to copy the files in the `custom` folder in order to modify the files:

`tar cf - . | (cd $HOME/yourfolder/custom; tar xfp -)`

You can now begin editing the files.

### Back in .iso

If not yet, go back to your `custom` folder.

Copy this line, modify it and paste it in order to create the .iso

`sudo mkisofs -o output.iso -b isolinux.bin -c boot.cat -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -J -R -V "Custom ISO Preseed" .`

### Make it bootable with isohybrid

Use the `isohybrid.pl` file of this repo like the following:

`sudo perl isohybrid.pl output.iso`

### umount and detach

Don't forget to do it, or you will can't be able to delete the `ro_iso` folder

`umount /dev/disk2`

`hdiutil detach /dev/disk2`

You now have a bootable USB iso file :)
